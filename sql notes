=====================================================================
Setting mysql at first after installation:-
1) sudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql
2) sudo mysql_secure_installation

=====================================================================
starting mysql:-
	
	mysql -u 'username' -p (hit enter)
	eg:- mysql -u himanshu -p
Clearing msql screen:- 
	ctrl+l

Common data types in SQL:-

	1. Numberic - INT , TINYINT , BIGINT , FLOAT
	2. String - VARCHAR(255) , TEXT(65000) , CHAR
	3. Date - DATE, DATETIME , TIMESTAMP
	4. Others -  BINARY , JSON 

Creating user for new DataBase:-
	CREATE USER 'name'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';

View all user in database:-
	SELECT user,host FROM mysql.user;

Granting privileges to user :-
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.f*  TO 'USER'@'LOCALHOST';

View Granted privileges:-
	SHOW GRANTS FOR 'USER'@'LOCALHOST';

Choosing user in mysql:-
	mysql -u username -p
	login in as a root user :- mysql -u root -p

Creating Database :-
	CREATE DATABASE database_name;

View Database :-
	SHOW DATABASES;
Deleting Database :- 
	DROP DATABASE database_name;

Choosing One Database To Use From Available Database:-
	USE database_name;

Creating Table:-
	CREATE TABLE table_name(

	);	
				     
	ex:- 		   		|---> Tabele Name  
		CREATE TABLE user(
		id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,	   -------
		first_name 	 VARCHAR(100),		 |
		last_name VARCHAR(100),		 	 |
		email VARCHAR(75),  		 	 |
		password VARCHAR(255),		 	 |-------> creating fields in table 
		location VARCHAR(100),			 |
		department VARCHAR(100),	 	 |
		is_admin TINYINT(1),		 	 |
		register_date DATETIME,	   -------
		PRIMARY KEY(id)			   ---------> use to set primary key
		);

Adding Foreign key in table:-
	FOREIGN KEY(fieldname) REFERENCES anotherTableName(fieldname);
	eg:- FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES user(id);

View Tables :-
	SHOW TABLES;

Deleting Table :-
	DROP TABLE table_name;

Inserting Data in Table :-
	1) Insert only single row data
		INSERT INTO table_name(coulumn_fields name separated by ',' )
		VALUES (data in single quotes separated by ',');

	2)Insert multiple rows at once
		INSERT INTO table_name(coulumn_fields name separated by ',' )
		VALUES (data in single quotes separated by ','),(Row_2 data),(Row_3 data),...;	
	
	** Coulumns can be in any order by remember you have to put data in same order in which order you have types coulumns name.



	ex:- Using About user table 
			INSERT INTO user(first_name,last_name,email,password,location,department,is_admin,register_date)
			VALUE ('Himanshu','Sharma','himanshusharma2972@gmail.com','123456','Gurgaon','IT',1,now()); 

				** now() is a function that automatically use system current data & Time. if you want to write manually simply	write like day/month/year. 

Selecting Data From Table :-
	
	1. Selecting Specified Fields:-
		SELECT field_name1,field_name2,.. FROM table_name;
		ex:- SELECT first_name,last_name FROM user;
	2. Selecting All Fields :- 
		SELECT * FROM table_name;
		ex:- SELECT * FROM user;
	3. Selecting Data by Filtering:- 
		A) Selecting using one condition
			SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE fieldname='matched_word';
			ex:- SELECT * FROM user WHERE location = 'gurgaon';
		B) Selecting using AND opertion means multiple condition
			SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE fieldname='matched_word' AND fieldname2='matched_word';
			ex:- SELECT * FROM user WHERE location = 'gurgaon' AND department='IT';
		C) We can select data using condition operator like '<','>','<=','>=','=';
			ex:- SELECT * FROM user WHERE is_admin > 0;

Adding Primary key in table :-
  	
	ALTER TABLE table_name ADD primary key (field_name);	

Deleting Data From Table :- 

	DELETE FROM table_name WHERE somecondition;
	ex:- DELETE FROM user WHERE id=3;

Updating Data From Table -
	
	UPDATE table_name SET fieldname='updated_data' WHERE KEY=VALUE;
	ex:- UPDATE user SET email='abc@gmail.com' WHERE id=3;

Adding new Field or coulumn into Table:-

	ALTER TABLE table_name ADD fieldname datatype ;
	eg:- ALTER TABLE user ADD age INT;

Modifying field type :-
	
	ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY fieldname datatype;
	eg:- ALTER TABLE user MODIFY age varchar(3);

Arranging rows in asending or desending order:-
	
	SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY fieldname DESC|ASC;  {DESC - Desending order , ASC - Asending order }
	eg:- SELECT * FROM user ORDER BY  first_name ASC; 

View data in Concatenating data fields :-
		
	SELECT CONCAT(fieldname1,' ',fieldname2) AS newFieldName, anotherFieldNameToView FROM tablename;
	eg:- SElECT CONCATE(first_name,' ',last_name) AS name , age FROM user;
		
		output:- name 			 | age
				himanshu sharma  | 20
				suraj singh bisht| 21
				arvind sharma 	 | 22

View data in different ways:-
	1)Suppose if we want to know how many different locations are there in database or how many age groups in database so
	we can do this as follows-
		eg:- SELECT DISTINCT location FROM user;
	2) We can select range also 
		 SELECT * FROM user WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
		 This will show you all the users comes between 20 and 30.

	3) If we want to view data by mathing some keywords from data
		a) If want to view data in which department starts with 'd' character so syntax is like 
				SELECT * FROM user WHERE department LIKE 'd%';
				it will list out all user whose department starts with d.
				Similary we can do for more characters.
			note:-  ** d% - if we add character before '%' sign then it will match starting words only 
				 	   %d - if we add character after '%' sign then it will match ending words only
				 	   %d%  - this we use when we want to match character in middle of word it may come at fist or last 		too
	4) If we want to view data that not match  some keywords from data Then we can simply replace 'LIKE' with 'NOT LIKE'
		eg:- SELECT * FROM user WHERE department NOT LIKE 'd%';

IN() Function:-
 	It is very useful function for seleting or view data
 	It can be consider as a replacement of equal statement at the time of selecting statments

 	for eg:- SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE fieldname IN(value1,value2,..);
 			eg:- SELECT * FROM user WHERE department IN('design','sales');
 	The above statement is equal to something like 
 			SELECT * FORM user WHERE department='design' AND department='sales';
