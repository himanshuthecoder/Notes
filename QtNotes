Creating Project in QT:-
---------------------------
1) First Make Directory for your project:-
	eg:- mkdir HelloWorld
2) Now create a Cpp file in your directory and write some code.
	eg:- main.cpp
3) Now make the QT project file using qmake command
	qmake -project
    * This command will create a file named HelloWorld.pro.
  This project file is the basic skeleton file for Qt projects and it can be edited for complex purposes.
4) Now edit the .pro file that you created in step 3 with your configurations like including 
   source files and which QT tool are you going to use etc.
	eg:- QT += gui widget  [this command means you are importing gui and widget module of QT]
	
5) Now run the command the $make this will create a an executable program in your directory.
6) Run the executable file using ./filename 

Now its done.
